This is a placeholder fee until Open Enrollment is completed. Open Enrollment is the annual period in which students must either enroll in or apply to waive the CMU SHIP.\n\nIf you do not complete Open Enrollment, you will be auto-enrolled in the CMU SHIP and the insurance fee will remain on your student account.\n\nIf you receive an approved waiver, the insurance fee will be credited back to your student account.\n\nPlease note that invoices do not update, as they are statements that reflect a point in time.

Waiting until later in the Open Enrollment period to enroll in the SHIP will not affect the coverage dates. SHIP coverage begins on August 1 each academic year, even if you do not submit your enrollment until the end of the open enrollment period"],

Students with an approved cancellation will receive a prorated refund of the remaining months' premiums on the medical, dental and/or vision plans (with adjustment for any PhD student insurance support, if applicable). SHIP cancellations are effective from the first of the month following the month in which the cancellation form is received. Cancellations are not permitted after March 31.\n\nIf you are graduating in December and would like to cancel your insurance plan, please Email shinsure@andrew.cmu.edu for assistance."],

This applies to the student medical, dental and vision plans; you cannot add the dental or vision plan outside of Open Enrollment without a qualifying event.\n\nIf you are enrolled in a plan, you can also add dependents who have had a qualifying event (for example, birth/adoption of a child or arrival to the U.S. for the first time during the coverage year).\n\nFor qualifying event enrollments into the medical, dental or vision plans, you have 90 days from the event to enroll and will need to provide supporting documentation.\n\nRemoving Dependents:\nDependents can be removed from your insurance plan at any time before March 31 of the coverage year.\nTo make any of these changes, please email shinsure@andrew.cmu.edu for assistance."],

Enrollment is based on eligibility and the application process can be lengthy. Students must also have applied for Medicaid before or during their open enrollment period.\n\nThe option to join a new plan does not make a student eligible to cancel their current insurance enrollment.\n\nIf you meet the last criterion, email UHS (shinsure@andrew.cmu.edu) when your university enrollment status has been updated to reflect one of the statuses listed above (or when you wish to remove a dependent or have been approved for Medicaid) and we can assist you. You may be eligible to receive a pro-rated refund for the remaining months' premiums.

If you have questions about the amount owed, the first step is to consult your Explanation of Benefits (EOB), which you can find in the claims sections of your Highmark portal. The EOB will describe what your insurance plan paid to the provider on your behalf.\n\nIf the bill does not show that insurance was applied to your bill, please contact the medical provider directly and give them your insurance information.\n\nIf you have questions about what was covered by your insurance, you can call the member services phone number on your insurance card.\n\nFor questions about medical bills or charges:\n- From an off-campus health care provider, contact the provider directly.\n- From University Health Services, call 412-268-2157 option 2 or email the UHS team.\n- For itemized statements from UHS, log into HealthConnect and select statements/receipts from the menu."],
        "14": ["Insurance related terms", 
               "Understanding an insurance plan can be confusing, so it is important to understand your planâ€™s benefits and coverage. To understand the SHIP, we recommend you review the planâ€™s Summary of Benefits and Coverage.\n\nProduced by the University of Michigan, this informative video (https://uhs.umich.edu/insurance-101-video) provides the basics about health insurance.\n\nYou can also Use the HealthCare.gov glossary (https://www.healthcare.gov/glossary/)  to understand MORE key terms.\n\nBeing familiar with the following terms will also be helpful:\n\nIn-Network and Out-of-Network: In-Network providers (doctors) or facilities (laboratories, urgent care centers, hospitals, or imaging centers) participate in your insurance plan network. The most cost effective way to seek care is to see healthcare providers that are in-network. If you have the CMU SHIP and see an in-network provider, there is no deductible. \nOut-of-Network providers do not participate in your insurance plan network. If you have the CMU medical SHIP and see an out-of-network provider, the plan will cover 80% of the cost of the service after you meet your deductible. The dental plan has different coinsurance rates.\n\nCopays: Copays are a one-time payment at the time of service and can range depending on the service being provided. For the CMU SHIP, most copays are $0-$25. Some services have a higher copay, such as advanced imaging ($40), emergency room visits ($125), and hospital admissions ($150). You must pay the copay once for each visit where it is applicable. Prescriptions also incur a copay, but copays depend on the type of medication and frequency of refill.\n\nDeductible: A deductible is the amount of money you pay for health care services before your insurance plan starts to pay covered expenses. It is important to review insurance plans so you are aware if there is a deductible or not. Once the deductible is met, the plan will start covering benefits as outlined in the policy. The CMU medical SHIP has no deductible for in-network care, but there is a deductible for out-of-network care. The dental SHIP has a deductible for both in-network and out-of-network care.\n\nCoinsurance: Coinsurance is a portion of healthcare charges that the member is responsible to pay, usually after a deductible has been met. There is no coinsurance for in-network care with the CMU medical SHIP. For out-of-network care with the CMU SHIP, you would be responsible for 20% of covered charges, after paying the deductible amount. Coinsurance rates vary depending on the plan and the service, so you must review plan(s) carefully.\n\nExplanation of Benefits (EOB): EOBs show the total charges for your visit and which portion of charges the health insurance plan will cover. EOBs are not bills. EOBs help you understand how much your health plan covers, and what you can expect to pay when you get a bill from your provider."]
